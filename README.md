Do the following:
1.Pick one use case (defined below).
2.Explore and research which algorithm would work best for this use case (regression or classification)
3.Document your findings in a file (3-5 lines) on why you chose this algorithm.
4.Train the algorithm using Python
5.Keep the solution as simple as possible. We are not looking for the best machine learning algorithm. We are interested in seeing that you know how to work with machine learning.
6.Publish the code on GitHub and send us the link

2.Predict passenger data for Ruter Use the same data set given to you in assignment 1. I want you to make a prediction algorithm which predicts the number of passengers on a specific date for a specific bus (pick any one). Input should be date and output will be number of passengers You should also show the prediction percentage score. Data file: Ruter_data.csv
